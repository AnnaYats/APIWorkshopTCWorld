Task 2.3
I joined a project a month ago. A technical writer left with no knowledge sharing at all.
I need to update the API reference documentation. The information I need is buried in Jira
tickets the team is working on. I can also find the necessary information in TFS together with
requirements descriptions. It is time-consuming to collect the information. I don’t know where to find
a json file. I can verify requests via a developer’s user he was kind enough to share, however,
I need to be very careful not to break anything. It seems to me that there is something wrong in the process.
Could you please help me?
