Task 2.1
I was assigned to this project a month ago.
The previous technical writer left. My task is to update the online help site that we generate via Postman.
Our development team works in Swagger, however, the information for online help site I should take from a
Confluence page that developers update from time to time. I can’t test any request as I don’t have access to
the production or QA environment. It seems to me that there is something wrong in the process?
Could you please help me?
