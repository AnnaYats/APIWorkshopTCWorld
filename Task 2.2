Task 2.2
I joined the project 3 months ago. There was no one to share the knowledge about API documentation processes,
but luckily there were video recordings. My task is to update the online API reference documentation that
we generate via Spectacle. There are a lot of technical details that I am not aware of and need to approach
developers all the time. I need to somehow update the json file, generate the html file via Spectacle,
create a new build, and publish to qa environment, verify everything is working, and send a build number
to dev ops so that they publish the documentation site. I verify requests via Postman. Even after watching all
the videos, I still donâ€™t know where to start. Please advise.
